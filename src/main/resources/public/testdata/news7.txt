Parents of children studying in Delhi Public School Ghaziabad (DPSG), Palam Vihar, and representatives of the school held a meeting with sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), north, Bharat Bhushan Gogia at his office at the mini-secretariat on Monday.

The meeting came after directions by Haryana public works department (PWD) minister and Badshahpur MLA Rao Narbir Singh to hear the grievances of the parents who are opposing the fee hike mandated by the school.

Parents from many private schools in Gurgaon have been holding protests for over a month against hikes in tuition fee and various other charges by schools. They have been doing the rounds of district authorities and education officials.

On Monday, after hearing both sides, the SDM said the authorities of DPSG school in Palam Vihar will not take action against the students who have not deposited their fee and also told the school not to charge late fee till the matter is resolved.

In the meeting, the parents told Gogia that they had admitted their wards to Chiranjeev Bharti School in Palam Vihar taking into account their financial status, but suddenly the school was taken over by DPSG. While the earlier school was run by a trust, DPSG is a private, self-funded school.

The parents said the school management suddenly hiked the fee this year and took it beyond their means, as a result of which they have been forced to launch an agitation.

They added that taking their wards out of the school and getting admission elsewhere was also beyond their financial ability and so they wanted the government to prevent a massive fee hike. Some parents also said that more than one of their wards study in the school, making it all the more difficult to bear the hiked fees.

Yashesh Yadav, a parent, said, “We used to get a heavy rebate in fee if children from a single family were studying in the school. This has also been stopped by the new management.”

Parents contended that it was illogical to increase the school fees by almost 60 to 70% and demanded a roll back. After hearing the parents’ side, Gogia asked the school management to take a humanitarian view of the problems being faced by them and the students and also voluntarily provide services such as midday meal.

The SDM suggested to the school authorities to form a parents-teacher association, after conducting elections, that would help in resolving such issues. He also directed the formation of a committee that would conduct an inspection of the school in the first week of July.

Another meeting of the school management and parents has been called on Wednesday to resolve the matter.

On Monday, a team of parents also met Amit Shah at BJP’s Delhi office. Parents told him about their problems and the protest against private schools. They also alleged rude behaviour by school authorities and told him about expulsion of wards from schools when parents raise their voice. “He assured us justice and advised us to wait for two months as the government is coming out with a strong ordinance for regulate the fee” said a parent.
