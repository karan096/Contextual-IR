        THE OFFENDING COMPUTER, WHICH WAS SHUT DOWN AFTER A LOS ANGELES
     TIMES REPORTER INVESTIGATING INTERNET HACKING ALERTED LAB OFFICIALS,
   CONTAINED MORE THAN 1,000 PORNOGRAPHIC IMAGES.  IT WAS BELIEVED TO BE THE
    LARGEST CACHE OF ILLEGAL HARD-CORE PORNOGRAPHY EVER FOUND ON A COMPUTER
                                   NETWORK.
                                       
        WHILE HACKERS ONCE DEVOTED THEIR EFFORTS TO DISRUPTING COMPUTER
    SYSTEMS AT LARGE ORGANIZATIONS OR STEALING ELECTRONIC INFORMATION, THEY
    HAVE NOW DEVELOPED WAYS OF SEIZING CONTROL OF INTERNET-LINKED COMPUTERS
      AND USING THEM TO STORE AND DISTRIBUTE PORNOGRAPHY, STOLEN COMPUTER
                    SOFTWARE AND OTHER ILLICIT INFORMATION.
                                       
           THE INTERNET, A "NETWORK OF NETWORKS" ORIGINALLY DESIGNED
    TO CONNECT COMPUTERS AT UNIVERSITIES AND GOVERNMENT RESEARCH LABS, HAS
   GROWN DRAMATICALLY IN SIZE AND TECHNICAL SOPHISTICATION IN RECENT YEARS.
    IT IS NOW USED BY MANY BUSINESSES AND INDIVIDUAL COMPUTER USERS, AND IS
    OFTEN VIEWED AS THE PROTOTYPE FOR THE "INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY" OF THE
                                    FUTURE.
                                       
       BUT THE INTERNET HAS AN UNDERSIDE, WHERE SO CALLED "PIRATES" WITH
      CODE NAMES LIKE "MR. SMUT," "ACIDFLUX," AND "THE COWBOY" TRAFFIC IN
    ILLEGAL OR ILLEGALLY OBTAINED ELECTRONIC INFORMATION.  THE STRUCTURE OF

     THE INTERNET MEANS THAT SUCH PIRATES CAN CARRY OUT THEIR CRIMES FROM
     ALMOST ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, AND TRACING THEM IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE.
                                       
          THE FBI LATE LAST WEEK CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS INVESTIGATING
   SOFTWARE PIRACY ON THE INTERNET.  A TIMES REPORTER DISCOVERED A NUMBER OF
     SITES AT PRESTIGIOUS INSTITUTUIONS THAT WERE BEING USED TO DISTRIBUTE
       STOLEN SOFTWARE, INCLUDING ONE IN THE OFFICE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF
                             CALIFORNIA, BERKELY.
                                       
        PIRATES ALSO HAVE THEIR OWN "CHAT" LINES, A SERIES OF CHANNELS
    WITHIN A SERVICE CALLED THE INTERNET RELAY CHAT.  AN ELABORATE PECKING
   ORDER DETERMINES WHO WILL BE ALLOWED TO TAKE PART IN THESE CONVERSATIONS
   - NEWCOMERS CAN OFTEN WANGLE THEIR WAY IN IF THEY HAVE A PARTICULARLY HOT
                          PIECE OF SOFTWARE TO OFFER.
                                       
       SANDY MEROLA, DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF INFORMATION AND COMPUTING AT THE
   BERKELY LAB, SIAD THAT THE PIRATE SITE WAS SHUT DOWN LAST WEEK AFTER THE
    TIMES INVESTIGATION REVEALED ITS EXISTENCE.  MEROLA SAID THE DEPARTMENT
    OF ENERGY, WHICH OVERSEES LAB OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS THE FBI, HAD BEEN
                           NOTIFIED OF THE INCIDENT.
                                       
        AT LAWRENCE LIVERMORE, OFFICIALS SAID MONDAY THAT THEY BELIEVED

     AT LEAST ONE MORE LAB EMPLOYEE WAS INVOLVED IN THE PORNOGRAPHY RING,
   ALONG WITH AN UNDETERMINED NUMBER OF OUTSIDE COLLABORATORS.  CHUCK COLE,
   DEPUTY ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF COMPUTING AT THE LAB, SAID THAT NEARLY 2,000
   MEGABYTES OF UNAUTHORIZED GRAPHICAL IMAGES HAVE BEEN FOUND IN A LIVERMORE
            COMPUTER, AND HE CONFIRMED THAT THEY WERE PORNOGRAPHIC.
                                       
       THE EMPLOYEE HAS BEEN PLACED ON "INVESTIGATORY LEAVE" AND HIS OR
   HER SECURITY BADGE CONFISCATED WHILE AN INVESTIGATION IS UNDERTAKEN, THE
   LAB SAID.  IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THE PORNOGRAPHIC IMAGES WERE BEING SOLD
       OR HOW MANY PEOPLE HAD GAINED ACCESS TO THEM.  THE PICTURES WERE
   SUFFICIENTLY GRAPHIC THAT THEY WOULD LIKELY BE CONSIDERED OBSCENE BY THE
  COURTS, AND THEREFORE TRANSMITTING THEM OVER THE INTERNET WOULD BE ILLEGAL.
                                       
         THE MASSIVE AMOUNT OF STORAGE CAPACITY USED IN THE LIVERMORE
         SCHEME SHOWS HOW INTERNET HACKING COULD BE QUITE PROFITABLE.
                                       
       THERE WERE INDICATIONS THAT THE PERSON OPERATING THE PORNOGRAPHY
    DATABASE HAD BECOME AWARE OF POSSIBLE SCRUTINY.  ON JUNE 27, A MESSAGE
   LEFT IN A FILE LABELED READ ME!!! SAID, "IT APPEARS THAT NEWS ABOUT THIS
     SITE HAS ESCAPED, IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS, I HAVE HAD 27 UN-AUTHORIZED
    HOSTS ATTEMPT TO ACCESS MY SERVER.  THIS DOES NOT GIVE ME A WARM-FUZZY
 FEELING.  I WOULD HATE TO HAVE TO SHUT THIS DOWN, BUT I MAY HAVE NO CHOICE."

                                                    Hackers in the News (25/92)
         ONE COMPUTER EXPERT, WHO REQUESTED ANONYMITY, SIAD THAT THERE
    MIGHT BE MORE TO THE INCIDENT THAN MEETS THE EYE.  THE EXPERT SUGGESTED
   THAT THE HARD-CORE PORNOGRAPHY MAY BE A COVER FOR AN ULTRA-SOPHISTICATED
      ESPIONAGE PROGRAM, IN WHICH A "SNIFFER" PROGRAM COMBS THROUGH OTHER
     LIVERMORE COMPUTERS, ENCODES THE PASSWORDS AND ACCOUNTS IT FINDS, AND
      THEN HIDES THEM WITHIN THE PORNOGRAPHIC IMAGES, PERHAPS LATER TO BE
                      DOWNLOADED LATER BY FOREIGN AGENTS.
                                       
         BUT COLE SAID THERE WAS NO POSSIBILITY OF A COMPUTER INTRUDER
             GAINING ACCESS TO CLASSIFIED DATA AT LIVERMORE LABS."
