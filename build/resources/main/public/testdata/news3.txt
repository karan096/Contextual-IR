NEW DELHI: BJP's success in retaining its votebank and managing a 3.9% increase over the 2015 assembly polls is being read by the party as benefits of demonetisation, the Centre's Mudra Bank loan and Ujjwala schemes that gave it a "pro-poor" orientation.
The strong welfare push seems to have given BJP a crucial edge in making inroads in the wards where it has fared poorly earlier and where delimitation was expected to favour its rivals. The demonetisation effect clubbed with focus on Poorvanchali community seems to have helped it gain votes in slums and unauthorised colonies. The JJ clusters, which have a sizable Poorvanchali population, had voted AAP to power in 2015.
The party sealed its victory due to three-way division of votes and AAP's share falling steeply from 54.3% to 26.2%, as compared to 2015. Delhi BJP in-charge Shyam Jaju said, "People have recognised the work done by the Modi government in the last three years."
"We held camps in east Delhi for Mudra scheme and helped many take benefit of Ujjwala (cooking gas for BPL) scheme," said Virendra Sachdeva, member of BJP's good governance cell and former district president of Mayur Vihar.
BJP's decision to appoint Bhojpuri actor-turned-politician Manoj Tiwari as Delhi unit chief worked well in capturing the Poorvanchali vote, which is now a key component in Delhi politics.
For the first time, the party gave tickets to 34 Poorvanchalis, including some from slums. "It was a major step that helped us win in areas like Trilokpuri west, which had never voted for the party. Tiwari's night stay in slums and villages helped," said Sachdeva.

In 2013, party candidate Vijay Bhagat had lost from Badli assembly constituency, but won from Sharda Nand Colony in 2017 municipal polls. Similarly, BJP has won in many wards in Burari, Kirari, Badarpur, Karawal Nagar, among others.
"In six assembly constituencies around Patparganj (represented by deputy CM Manish Sisodia), we have won close to 25 wards. We lost Jhilmil and our candidate's nomination was rejected from Vinod Nagar," said Abhay Verma, state vice-president.
Focussing its campaign around PM Narendra Modi and people's perceived anger against AAP helped neutralise anti-incumbency. The three corporations had failed on numerous counts during the party's decade-long rule.
Even delimitation seems to have worked out in BJP's favour. The party won three out of five wards in Najafgarh, the assembly constituency that BJP has won just once in 2013. Similarly, in Badarpur, the party won four out of five wards. The party also managed to retrieve more of its middle-class areas, ike Vishwas Nagar, Greater Kailash and Malviya Nagar that voted for Modi in 2014, but went with AAP in 2015.
